## Cost Analysis

### Per Campaign:
- Image Generation: $0.02 (Kie.ai Nano Banana)
- Meta Ads Spend: $20/day per campaign
- **Total Daily Cost per Campaign:** $20.02

### Automated Schedule:
- Campaigns Created: 1 every 15 minutes
- Daily Campaigns: 96 campaigns/day (24 hours × 4 per hour)
- **Projected Daily Spend:** $1,921.92 in Meta Ads + $1.92 in image generation = **$1,923.84/day**

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** This is the maximum theoretical spend if all campaigns run for full 24 hours. Actual spend will be lower based on:
- Campaign performance (poor performers get paused)
- Budget pacing by Meta
- Lead generation volume
- Manual oversight and optimization

## Troubleshooting

### If campaigns stop creating:
1. Check Docker containers: `docker-compose ps`
2. Check systemd timer: `systemctl status meta-ads-master.timer`
3. Check logs: `docker-compose logs --tail=100`
4. Restart services: `docker-compose restart`

### If campaigns are rejected:
1. Check Meta Ads Manager for policy violations
2. Review ad copy for compliance
3. Verify landing page is accessible
4. Check for special ad category requirements

### If budget is too high:
1. Reduce campaign creation frequency (edit systemd timer)
2. Lower daily budget per campaign (edit systemd service)
3. Pause underperforming campaigns manually
